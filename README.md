### Description
For several years, my parents used a set of radio frequency outlets to turn on/off a few lamps in their living room. I always appreciated the functionality and convenience when I would go visit; however, sometimes finding the accompanying RF remote was cumbersome because it often lodged iteslf into the most unlikely cracks and crevices.  
At some point, I found myself a burgeoning Computer Science major who possessed a set of RF outlets, a Raspberry Pi, and the spirit of ~~laziness~~ innovation.
